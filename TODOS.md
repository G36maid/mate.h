# [TODOS](https://github.com/TomasBorquez/mate.h/issues/9)

### v0.2
- [ ] Add `args` parser
- [ ] Shared libs
- [ ] raylib-source-code
    - [ ] option shared (`-fPIC`, `-DBUILD_LIBTYPE_SHARED`)
    - [ ] option linux_backend (`wayland/x11`)
    - [ ] option optional modules such as `rshapes`, `rtextures`, etc
    - [ ] option platform such as `glfw`, `SDL`, etc
    - [ ] option opengl version
    - [ ] default config from `src/config.h` else `-DEXTERNAL_CONFIG_FLAGS`
- [ ] `InstallHeader()` and other various library builder functions
- [ ] `LinkStaticLib()` for linking another `StaticLib`
- [ ] Full `MSVC` support on static/shared libs
- [ ] Header tests like on `CMAKE`
- [ ] Add `MacOS` support (find someone who is willing to help)
- [ ] Make `samurai` windows compatible
- [ ] Properly clean the state of arenas and vectors
- [ ] `clang-formatter` as a github action (when many contributions)

### v0.1
- [x] Create `amalgam-script.c` as well as `pre-commit hook`
- [x] Examples folder that serves as tests
- [x] Full Linux support
- [x] `FLAG_DEBUG` -g3 rather than -g *when supported* since -g3 generates more information
- [x] Add glob pattern on `AddFile` using `ListDirectory`
- [x] Switch to samurai instead of ninja files (for now only bootstrap on linux)
- [x] Actually parse `mate-cache.ini`
- [x] Add `TCC` support
- [x] Add better error messages
    - [x] Remove file errors unless they are critical, and always check errors
    - [x] Instead of assertions add `LogError/Abort` custom function
    - [x] If someone doesnt use `StartBuild` before creating executable
    - [x] Uses `InstallExecutable` before creating executable
- [x] Refactor code
    - [x] Cache states is unclear
    - [x] String function names are unclear for paths
    - [x] Optimize Mate Built-in String functions
    - [x] String functions shouldn't be by reference unless necessary
    - [x] String builder function
    - [x] Use String builder function
    - [x] Remove unnecessary code
    - [x] Add comments on `api.h`
- [x] Semi Support for `MSVC` 
- [x] Static libs 
- [x] `FlagBuilder` and `AddFlag(builder, ...)`:
    - [x] Similar to `StringBuilder` but it uses `mateState.arena` and `AddFlag` can add many flags plus they have a `" "` by default
    - [x] Use when parsing flags in `CreateStaticLib` and `CreateExecutable`
    - [x] Move to it in flag parsing for `./tests/07-raylib-source-code`
- [x] Move private functions to `__mate_` and snake_case
- [x] Add `FMT_I64` and `FMT_I32` to remove warnings
- [x] Move back to camelCase but mate prefix for private `mateFunction`
