- [x] Examples folder that serves as tests
- [x] Full Linux support
- [x] `FLAG_DEBUG` -g3 rather than -g *when supported* since -g3 generates more information
- [x] Add glob pattern on `AddFile` using `ListDirectory`
- [x] Switch to samurai instead of ninja files (for now only bootstrap on linux)
- [x] Actually parse `mate-cache.ini`
- [x] Add `TCC` support

    - [x] Remove file errors unless they are critical, and always check errors
